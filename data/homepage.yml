    <p class="lead">
      I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a unique journey that combines medical science and software development. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      My transition from medicine to technology exemplifies my adaptability and commitment to continuous learning. 
      Having completed an intensive Full Stack Software Development program at Code Institute, I've developed a comprehensive  
      understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies. As an enthusiastic and driven developer, I approach each project 
      with analytical precision honed through my medical background  and master's in biomedical sciences.

But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
